# SlashRead
**SlashRead**, or **/read**, is the emote that pulls out your map while looking at either a mailbox or the map. I mainly wanted this addon to give the feeling that the character is actually looking at something rather than staring off into space when looking through various windows on the User Interface.
This addon adds the **/read** functionality to many other frames, including:
Achievement, Archaeology, Artifact, Auction House, Keybind / Interface / System Options, Blackmarket Auction House, Calendar, Character, Collection Journal, Encounter Journal, Flight Map, Garrison and Order Hall Frames, Guild, Guild Bank, LFG, Macro, Obliterum Forge, Quests, Friends, Store, Talents, Tradeskill, "What's New" Frame, Help Frame, Merchant, Void Storage.

## Upcoming Features
Various AddOn frames such as AtlasLoot and option windows for AddOns.
Some AddOns may be incompatiblebecausethey completely overhaul the UI or alter the frame, in which case I would need to make a plugin for it.

Original idea is taken from [Lore Library](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/lorelibrary).
